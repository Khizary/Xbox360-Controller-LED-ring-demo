# Xbox360-Controller-LED-ring-demo
A pyfirmata based implement to get joystick information from an xbox 360 wired controller and use it to illuminate corresponding LEDs configured in an octet on a breadboard connected to an Arduino uno board


A project I made in an attempt to understand pyfirmata operation as well as getting input from a videogame-gcontroller in python. It was made in 2020, but I rediscovered the files recently.
